description: Perched atop the Dangrek Mountains along the Cambodia–Thailand border, Preah Vihear Temple is a stunning 11th-century Hindu sanctuary dedicated to Shiva. Known for its dramatic clifftop setting and intricate Khmer architecture, the temple offers breathtaking views of the plains below and stands as a symbol of national pride and cultural heritage.

Preah Vihear stands—
stone prayers on cliff's edge whisper
to skies and silence.
