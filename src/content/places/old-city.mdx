description: Jerusalem’s Old City is a historic walled enclave at the heart of the city, sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Within its narrow alleys lie ancient landmarks like the Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and Al-Aqsa Mosque, reflecting centuries of faith, conflict, and coexistence.

Stone paths whisper tales,
Minarets and church bells ring—
Faith in every breath.
