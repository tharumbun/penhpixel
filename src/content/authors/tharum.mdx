I began my blogging journey in June 2004 while I was a student at the National University of Management and working on a bridging digital divide project. This marked the start of my role in Cambodiaâ€™s digital media landscape.

Since then, I have been recognized as a pioneer in Cambodian blogging, sharing insights on media, technology, and society through my personal blog at [tharum.com](https://tharum.com).
